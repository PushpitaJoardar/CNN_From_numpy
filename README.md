# CNN_From_numpy
This is a very simple implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN). It is implemented completely from scratch using only numpy. The network is trained on the NumtaDB dataset to recognize Bengali numerical digits. Moreover, there is a Testing file to do prediction and measure accuracy_score, log_loss and f1_score performance metrics.
